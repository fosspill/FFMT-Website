# Backup and Restore
## Backup your index files

After installing the game or receiving a game patch it's important to backup your clean index files.

1. Create a backup of your clean index files

	```
	> ffmt backup
	```

These are stored in the directory you've chosen in the configuration file (see [First-time setup](userguide/quickstart/setup)) or defined with argument (-b, --backupdirectory)



## Resetting

Resetting ensures that the index files are back to stock:
 
     ```
     > ffmt reset
     ```
